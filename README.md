# Python-stuff

This is a collection of short python scripts created by TJNuzza. There is no unifying theme.
It includes a collection of various sorting algorithms,
statistical calculators related to Baseball,
statistical calculators related to D&D, and a few other things.
Every script is Python 3, and up to now all of them are console applications.

## Update information

As of 27 July 2019 there are only individual scripts in this repository,
and no dependencies or third party libraries should be necessary.
