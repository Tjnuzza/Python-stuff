# Python Stuff

This is a collection of short python scripts created by TJNuzza.
There is no unifying theme, because most of these were made when I was bored or to solve a specific problem.
It includes a collection of various sorting algorithms,
statistical calculators related to Baseball,
statistical calculators related to D&D, and a few other things.
Every script is Python 3.

## How to use
All of these programs are terminal scripts, and many of them require no user input
(because I would just change the hardcoded values if I needed to).
The few that require user input will prompt the user accordingly.

## Roulette script
One of these scripts is a roulette game. It is in fact an early version of the roulette console application
that I made in C++ in another repository, and is played the same way.

## Update information

As of 11 August 2019 there are only individual scripts in this repository,
and no dependencies or third party libraries should be necessary.
