This is a collection of short python scripts created by TJNuzza. There is no unifying theme.
It includes a collection of various sorting algorithms,
statistical calculators related to Baseball,
statistical calculators related to D&D, and a few other things.

As of 21 July 2019 there are only individual scripts in this file,
